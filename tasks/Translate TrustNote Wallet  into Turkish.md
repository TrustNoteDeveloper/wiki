Itâ€™s nice to speaking to you !
As discussed, please find information below:
The English resource file (template.pot) can be found from the following link https://github.com/trustnote/trustnote-wallet/tree/master/i18n/po
You can rename the file into tr-TR.pot and add Turkish translation into the msgstr like this: msgid "(English)" msgstr "(Turkish)"
In the same GitHub folder you can find a file called zh-CN.pot, that is a Chinese resource file and you can use that one as an example.
And you can download TrustNote wallet from https://github.com/trustnote/trustnote-wallet/releases
Let me know if you have any further questions.
