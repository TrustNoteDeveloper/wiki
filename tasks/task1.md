# TrustNote Wallet Localization: Volunteers Needed

Hello everyone!

I am glad to let you know that we are working on language localization for the TrustNote wallet, the wallet was first released on 18th January 2018, the same day when the TrustNote main net went live!

At the time when I write this blog, TrustNote wallet has went through several updates according to the roadmap. As of now, we have 25,427 active users who have zero-balance in their wallet accounts, and the number is growing every day! 

Along with the growing awareness and adoption, we received feedbacks that some of our users hope to get the wallet in their native language and we know it will be more convenient for you, and your friends to use, enjoy, and share!

As we don’t speak every language that our users would like to support, and even if we speak, we don’t speak it that well, and because we are an open source project and we are not charging for any of the software we develop, we have to focus our resource on software development and it is unlikely that we’ll be hiring some translation agencies to do the job. This means we will need your help if you want to see some new languages or improvement to the existing language.

For the wallet, there are a little more than 1000 “lines” to be translated, most of them are very shot. We are applying a free open-source license to use a well-known localization platform to make the translation and approval process as easy as possible. If all 1000 lines are too much for you, you are welcomed to translate, proofreading, or submitting bugs as little as you can, many times even one line can make a big difference. 
Right now, TrustNote wallet is available in English and Chinese, we have received suggestions from our users to support Japanese and German, and we hope to support Turkish and French because we see these two areas also have a relative large user base. 
If you want to participate or have any suggestions or questions, please feel free to contact me directly at bob@trustnote.org, and I’ll talk to you on whatsapp or telegram. 

As a community, from time to time, we will evaluate the contributions made by every volunteers. Volunteers that have provided significant contribution to project localization will be recognized for their outstanding work and dedication, and will be rewarded with TTT tokens as appreciation (not payment) for the quality of the work submitted.  We believe the real worth and reward from this process is to jointly build a new world where everyone can participate, all things can be tokenized, and transactions can be conducted on a truly decentralized network. In this way, everyone can have their own digital assets and gain corresponding rewards through value exchange, allowing new innovative ideas to run smoothly and flourish on the blockchain, making the use of blockchain a lifestyle.

For those who want to take a look at the localization file before making decisions, you are welcomed to check it out from GitHub at https://github.com/trustnote/trustnote-wallet/tree/master/i18n/po

Thanks everyone!
